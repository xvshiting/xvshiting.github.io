<span style="color:grey"><i> --- NLP  as well as Deep Learning could not only help machines better understand human beings , but also help us to know ourselves better.</i></span>



**My** name is **xu shiting(许士亭)** or **will xu**.I am looking for an opportunity for a **phd** program realated to **NLP or Data Mining**.

**My research interests** are *machine learning, NLP, Deep Learning and Data Mining*. I think those researching areas provide us with new lights to perceive data we have and the world we live. So I am very interested in erecting novel models and admiring effects it bring to the world. I have also worked on *Information Security related to malicious software classification* before.

### Others

- <font style="color:grey"> I have been performing magic for nearly ten years. My favourite class of magic is card magic because it can be shown in almost any conditions like on desks or standing up. I had been president of magic club in my undergraduated college for 2 years and performed stage magic many times for the Welcome Party for the Freshmen. My favourite card magician is shin lim since his magic effects are so visual that like real magic and I also like his rhythm of performance, his choice of the background music and his emotion conveyed in his masterpiece. He is also the champion of FISM which is Olympic game in magic area. I also like cardistry, emerging in recent ten years, an finger activity using cards.</font>
