### Breif Bio

<span style="color:grey"><i> --- NLP  as well as Deep Learning could not only help machines better understand human beings , but also help us to know ourselves better.</i></span>



**My** name is **xu shiting(许士亭)** or **will xu**.I am looking for an opportunity for a **phd** program realated to **NLP or Data Mining**.

**My research interests** are *machine learning, NLP, Deep Learning and Data Mining*. I think those researching areas provide us with new lights to perceive data we have and the world we live. So I am very interested in erecting novel models and admiring effects it bring to the world. I have also worked on *Information Security related to malicious software classification* before.
